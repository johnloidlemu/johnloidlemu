# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hello! I'm Johnloid, a passionate Computer Science student and talented portrait graphite pencil artist. I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science at Isabela State University, where I am deeply engaged in exploring the intersections of technology and art.

My GitHub profile showcases a range of projects that reflect my dedication to innovation and creativity. From developing dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to contributing to open-source projects like `Streamlit_Fundamentals_notes`, my work aims to blend technical proficiency with artistic insight.

In addition to my programming endeavors, I am an avid portrait artist, capturing human emotion and detail through graphite pencil. My artistic creations and coding projects are driven by the same passion for crafting unique and impactful solutions.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me. I'm always excited to collaborate on new projects and share knowledge with fellow enthusiasts!

Thank you for visiting my profile!
